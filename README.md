## Simple task-app utilizing [json-backend-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)
We are essentially using the json as a backend infrastructure similar to ways that node, django, or other frameworks so that we can make API
requests to it using post,get,delete etc


### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run the JSON server by running following:
```
npm run server
```

## Now that the json server(db) is built we can now run our dev container 

```
npm start 
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## will be fully funcitoning if NPM packages were correctly installed*
